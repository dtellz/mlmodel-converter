## Overview

This converter allows you to quickly transform pre-trained Hugging Face models (such as GPT-2 for text generation) into Core ML models suitable for on-device inference on Apple devices.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management

## Setup

Clone and initialize the project:

```bash
git clone <repo_link>
cd mlmodel-converter
uv install
```

## Usage

### Converting a Hugging Face model

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

### Parameters

The cli will prompt you to enter the following parameters:

- `model_name`: The Hugging Face model name to convert (e.g., 'sarahai/your-inspiration')
- `output_filename`: The output Core ML model filename (without .mlmodel extension)

### Output

This generates a .mlmodel file in the project directory (e.g., `<output_filename>.mlmodel`) ready for integration into Xcode.

### Integration into Xcode

Drag the generated .mlmodel file into your Xcode projectâ€™s file navigator. Xcode automatically generates a Swift class to interact with the model.
